# Extracting Neutrino Oscillations Parameters from a Log-Likelihood Fit
Abstract—Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) for the survival
probability of neutrino oscillations was minimised to find model
values that described the physical phenomenon. A 2D Univariate
parabolic minimiser and N-dimensional Simulated Annealing
minimiser was applied to obtain these parameters. Errors for
Univariate were found by assessing the curvature and errors
for Simulated Annealing assessing NLL shifted by 0.5. For
Univariate, NLL = 605.1 and for Simulated Annealing, NLL= 113.2 where θ_23 = 0.7278 ± 0.0168rad, ∆m_23 = (2.8541 ±
0.0398) × 10 eV and α = 1.6162 ± 0.0803m eV 


Additionally, the methods were verified and tested using the Ackley and sphere function, with colour maps plotted to assess the steps taken by each minimiser. Error using the second derivative of the negative log-likelihood was also explored to assess closeness of fit. A ‘Probabilistic Cooling Scheme’ in Simulated Annealing was implemented to reduce temperatures efficiently.
